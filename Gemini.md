1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as comprehensive as possible. We want to avoid making any mistakes. Think of all the ways the code coould possible go wrong and implement checks for them at each step of the way.
7. There will be no place holder/ temporary code, everything you do has to be production ready!
8. Always keep in mind the vision of the project we are building below --- 
Gita Project Checklist and Commentary

This document provides a detailed checklist of the original project brief requirements for "Gita" and commentary on how each requirement was addressed in the implemented solution.

1. Vision & Executive Summary


Requirement: Desktop-first, note-taking application inspired by Roam Research, designed for researchers, writers, students, and professionals who think in a non-linear, networked fashion. Core is a block-based, bi-directionally linked database of notes.


Commentary: Fully Implemented. The application is built as a Tauri desktop application, providing a native desktop experience. The core note-taking functionality is block-based, inspired by Roam Research, and uses a PostgreSQL database to store notes in a structured, linked manner.




Requirement: Killer feature: deep integration of audio. Users can record audio (from their microphone and system) concurrently while taking notes. Every block created is automatically timestamped against the audio recording. This allows users to instantly jump to the precise moment in a conversation, lecture, or meeting when a particular note was taken, bridging the gap between written thought and spoken context.


Commentary: Fully Implemented. A sophisticated Rust audio engine (using cpal and hound) handles concurrent microphone and system audio recording. Each block created while recording is automatically timestamped and stored in the database, allowing for precise audio playback from the corresponding moment.




Requirement: Build upon the open-source free-roam project for the core editor experience and wrap it in a Rust/Tauri shell to provide robust, cross-platform desktop audio capabilities.


Commentary: Addressed by design. Due to sandbox limitations preventing direct forking and building on free-roam, the core editor experience (block-based editing, linking) was re-implemented from scratch in React/TypeScript to match the free-roam functionality and integrate seamlessly with the new backend. The application is indeed wrapped in a Rust/Tauri shell for cross-platform desktop capabilities.



2. Core User Stories


Requirement: As a user, I want to... create daily notes to journal my thoughts and tasks.


Commentary: Fully Implemented. The frontend includes a sidebar with a calendar-like navigation that allows users to easily create and access daily notes. New daily notes are automatically created if they don't exist for a selected date.




Requirement: As a user, I want to... create notes as nested bullet points (blocks).


Commentary: Fully Implemented. The MainEditor and BlockEditor components provide a block-based editing interface with support for nested bullet points, mirroring the Roam Research style.




Requirement: As a user, I want to... link pages together using [[Page Title]] syntax to create a networked knowledge base.


Commentary: Fully Implemented. The frontend parses [[Page Title]] syntax within block content, creating clickable links that navigate to the corresponding pages. The backend handles the creation and retrieval of pages (blocks marked as is_page).




Requirement: As a user, I want to... reference a specific block from anywhere in my graph using ((Block Reference)).


Commentary: Partially Implemented (Conceptual). While the core block structure and linking mechanism are in place to support this, explicit ((Block Reference)) parsing and rendering in the frontend were not fully implemented due to time constraints and the complexity of real-time bidirectional updates. The underlying database schema supports this relationship.




Requirement: As a user, I want to... start a recording on any page that captures both my microphone and any audio playing on my computer.


Commentary: Fully Implemented. The AudioControls component provides a microphone button to start and stop recordings. The Rust audio_engine uses cpal to capture both microphone input and system audio output concurrently.




Requirement: As a user, I want to... see a visual indicator that a recording is active.


Commentary: Fully Implemented. A pulsing red dot is displayed in the header when audio recording is active, providing clear visual feedback to the user.




Requirement: As a user, I want to... have every block I create automatically timestamped against the active audio recording.


Commentary: Fully Implemented. When a recording is active, every new block created by the user is automatically associated with the current timestamp of the ongoing audio recording in the audio_timestamps table.




Requirement: As a user, I want to... click a play icon next to a block to listen to the audio from the exact moment that note was written.


Commentary: Fully Implemented. Blocks that have an associated audio timestamp display a play icon. Clicking this icon triggers playback of the corresponding audio recording from the precise timestamp when the note was taken
